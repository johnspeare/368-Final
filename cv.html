    		<p>Before I was a graduate student and a composition teacher, I was a program manager and a technical writer at a big software company. 
           I worked there for a long time. It was a great, tough, exhilarating, challenging, and fruitful experience. <br>
					 While I did software stuff, I wrote some bikey-stuff for local and national magazines on the side. For the last couple years I've also been working for Elephant Bikes. 
				And about five years ago, my wife, friends, and I co-founded a community bike shop called Pedals2People.</p>
