			  <h2>Information Design Project: Oven Pancake</h2>
				<p>After spending a quarter in the depths of information, visual, and design theory, I wanted to apply it. I created a recipe design that shows how to make a yummy breakfast treat. As it turns out, creating an "easy" or "simple" design is friggin' hard.</p>

			  <h2>Papers</h2>
				<p>Here are some papers I've written this year in the Rhetoric and Technical Communications graduate program.</p>
				<ul id="papers">
				<li><a href="pdf/Jspeare503-AnalyticalStudyofDummy.pdf">ENGL 503: Gestalt, Grice, Riley, Parker, Kostelnick, and Dummies</a>(.pdf)<br>
				Why are the "Dummie" books so successful? Well, there are lots of reasons, but I'm sure that the coolest sounding reason is this: Implicature.</li>
				<li><a href="pdf/Contemporary_Rhetoric.pdf">ENGL 575: Some Useful Manifestations of Contemporary Rhetoric</a> (.pdf)<br>
				Post-modern rhetorical theory is dense and problematic in many ways. In this paper I attempt to square up my sprawling thoughts by forcing contemporary theory into a framework that describes how we might find rhetoric useful today. whew!</li>
				<li><a href="Speare-511-Research-Critical_Digital_Lit.pdf">Incorporating Critical Technical Literacy into a College Composition Program</a>(.pdf)<br>
				Most scholars would agree that we ought to incorporate  digital literacy into our  composition courses. But what might this look like? This paper reviews some digital projects and evaluates them according to critical digital pedogogy. It also describes why a composition department-specific web server is a preferred student publishing solution.</li>
