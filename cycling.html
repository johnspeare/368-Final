    	  <h1>cycling</h1>
    		<p>I love riding bikes. I like them because they're fun -- all of the other benefits (and there are many) are secondary to the fun part. I commute mostly. But when I have time I like to take longer rides -- a day, or maybe a few days. My favorite riding it to explore the quiet and beautiful dirt roads of the National and State forests in Washington with friends.</p>

			  <h2>Friends</h2>
				<p>I'm lucky to have a bunch of friends. Most of them ride bikes. And many of those bike riders are obsessed with bikes.</p>

			  <h2>Advocacy</h2>
				<p>I used to do a lot of bike-related advocacy. I've sat on a few boards and attended many meetings for many different events and organizations. Of all the work I've done, I'm most proud of is Pedals2People. Pedals2People is a non-profit community bike shop in Spokane. My wife, friends, and I co-founded P2P about five years ago. </p>

			  <h2>Writing</h2>
				<p>I've done a ton of bike-related writing over the last few years. Of course I have a <a href="http://cyclingspokane.blogspot.com">blog.</a> For about five years I wrote the column "Everyday Cyclist" for local print magazine, <i>Out There Monthly</i>. I also published a couple pieces in national magazines: blah and blah.</p>
